# go-media todo-list

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

Things that work
Add a task
Edit A Task
Delete A Task
Complete a task
Show tasks in completed or not completed filter (needs some work I think)

Things I would fix if I had more time.
1.) Load Not completed tasks by default instead of completed
2.) Styling of completed tasks needs fixing (strikethrough class isnt being applied it would seem)
